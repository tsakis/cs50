Almost 2h just to run breakout on Ubuntu x64 (14.04) - such fun!

- SPL code downloaded from
https://github.com/cs50/spl

- make worked
- make install, I copied manually libcs.a and spl.jar to /usr/local/lib

- When trying to run breakout I had the following error:
Error: Could not find or load main class stanford.spl.JavaBackEnd
  
- Turns out it is a classpath problem (I guess!), since I copied spl.jar inside the breakout folder and it worked! ....

(Beware there may be steps that I forgot to write down)
